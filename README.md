# Termux Tutorials
This is a repository of tutorials of how to do random stuff on Termux. Decided to make this as a way to share knowledge I gathered when I decided to turn an old phone into a server.

You can download plain Markdown files by cloning the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/adrianvic/termux-tutorials) or check the [GitHub Pages website](https://adrianvic.github.io/termux-tutorials) made with Jekyll.

If you're in the website, you will probably want to see the [Tutorial Listing](https://adrianvic.github.io/termux-tutorials/tutorials/) page.
