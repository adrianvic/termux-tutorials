# How to install Termux
Termux is available to download both on F-Droid and Google Play store.

All tutorials are made to work with the F-Droid version, as Google imposes various limitations to what Termux can do.

**Note:** You can download the F-Droid version of Termux without downloading F-Droid itself, however you won't receive updates. F-droid is an open-source app store that provides only free and open-source (FOSS) software, installing it does not imply any security risk, even though Google will try to scare you when you install it.

Downloading Termux is as simple as going to your app store of choice (Play Store or F-Droid) and installing it.

Alternatively, you can download directly from the Termux GitHub repository.
